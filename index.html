                    Sleeping well directly affects your mental
                    and physical health. Fall short and it can 
                    take a serious toll on your daytime energy,  
                    productivity, emotional balance, and even your 
                    weight. Yet many of us regularly toss and 
                    turn at night, struggling to get the sleep we need.

                    Getting a good night’s sleep may seem like an
                    impossible goal when you’re wide awake at 3 a.m.,
                    but you have much more control over the quality
                    of your sleep than you probably realize.

                    Unhealthy daytime habits and lifestyle choices
                    can leave you tossing and turning at night and
                    adversely affect your mood, brain and heart health,
                    immune system, creativity, vitality, and weight.
                    But by experimenting with the following tips, you
                    can enjoy better sleep at night, boost your health,
                    and improve how you think and feel during the day.

                        Getting in sync with your body’s
                        natural sleep-wake cycle, or circadian
                        rhythm, is one of the most important
                        strategies for sleeping better. 
                        If you keep a regular sleep-wake schedule,
                        you’ll feel much more refreshed and
                        energized than if you sleep the same
                        number of hours at different times,
                        even if you only alter your sleep
                        schedule by an hour or two.

                    <p>
                        Melatonin is a naturally occurring hormone 
                        controlled by light exposure that helps regulate
                        your sleep-wake cycle. Your brain secretes more 
                        melatonin when it’s dark—making you sleepy—and 
                        less when it’s light—making you more alert. 
                        However, many aspects of modern life can alter
                        your body’s production of melatonin and shift 
                        your circadian rhythm.

                        People who exercise regularly sleep better at night
                        and feel less sleepy during the day. Regular exercise
                        also improves the symptoms of insomnia and sleep 
                        apnea and increases the amount of time you spend in 
                        the restorative stages of sleep.

                        <br>
                        Exercise speeds up your metabolism, elevates body
                        temperature, and stimulates hormones such as cortisol.

                    <ul>
                        <li>The more vigorously you exercise, the more powerful the sleep benefits
                            But even light exercise—such as walking for just 10 minutes a day—improves sleep quality.

                            It can take several months of regular activity before you experience
                            the full sleep-promoting effects. Focus on building
                            an exercise habit that sticks.

                        Taking steps to manage your overall stress levels 
                        and learning how to curb the worry habit can make it
                        easier to unwind at night.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Problems clearing your head at night can also stem from 
                        your daytime habits. The more overstimulated your 
                        brain becomes during the day, the harder it can be to slow
                        down and unwind at night. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Maybe, like many of us, you’re 
                        constantly interrupting tasks during the day to check 
                        your phone, email, or social media. Then when it comes to
                        getting to sleep at night, your brain is so accustomed
                        to seeking fresh stimulation, it becomes difficult to unwind.

                    <h3>Breathing Exercise</h3>
                    <p>Breathing from your belly rather than your chest can 
                       activate the relaxation response and lower your heart rate,
                       blood pressure, and stress levels to help you drift off to sleep.</p>

                        A peaceful bedtime routine sends a powerful signal to your brain
                        that it’s time to wind down and let go of the day’s stresses. Sometimes
                        even small changes to your environment can make a big difference 
                        to your quality of sleep.

                    <h3>Tips</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Keep noise down.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Make sure your bed is comfortable.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Keep your room cool. Most people sleep best in a slightly cool room (around 65° F or 18° C) with adequate ventilation. </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Reserve your bed for sleeping and sex. By not working, watching TV, 
                            or using your phone, tablet, or computer in bed, your brain will associate
                            the bedroom with just sleep and sex, which makes it easier to wind 
                            down at night.</li>

                    <h3>Tips</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Make relaxation your goal, not sleep. If you
                            find it hard to fall back asleep, try a relaxation
                            technique such as visualization, progressive 
                            muscle relaxation, or meditation.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Do a quiet, non-stimulating activity. If you’ve been 
                            awake for more than 15 minutes, get out of bed and do a
                            quiet, non-stimulating activity, such as reading a book</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Postpone worrying and brainstorming. If you wake during 
                            the night feeling anxious about something, make a brief note
                            of it on paper and postpone worrying about it until the 
                            next day when it will be easier to resolve.</li>
